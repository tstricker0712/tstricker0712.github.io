    				<p>1. Git is a free open source version control system. It can handle small or very large projects very efficiently.
					2. Linus Torvalds created git. 3. A hub is a central network. 4. Respitory is a directory and storage place for the projects.
					It's job is to help you keep track of your projects. 5. I think GitHub is a very awesome site for companies and groups to share files and coding projects.
					It is by far one of the easiest ways to have a group all work on a project togeather and keep track of changes and updates over time.</p>
